<h1>Documentation and tutorial for <span  style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> </h1>


<!--

<p>
  The server lets users mutate proteins in
  various ways and study mutation effects in 3D.
  The only required inputs are a structural model and a list of mutations of
  interest.
  Alternatively, the user can upload human SNPs in the VCF format.
  <br>
  You can click on the       <span class="center-align toggle-card"> <button data-target="modal3" class="btn modal-trigger grey lighten-2" title="Further information" style="margin:5px;">i</button> </span> buttons at each field in the forms to get further information.

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            The <span class="mut-ex">MutationExplorer</span> maps variants onto the protein 3D structure which allows to interactively explore the effects of mutations with respect to stability and function. Often wwPDB structures contains mutations and can not intuitively be mapped to its native sequence, sequences of structures changed to close or remote homologs or structures designed interactive while inspecting the structure. With the <span class="mut-ex">MutationExplorer</span> this is now easily possible and even visualises the effect of the variant on the protein structures stability.

            Energy minimization - the key to high quality
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
            <p>
              The minimization is crucial for the quality of the outcome. The better the structure is energetically minimized, the more reliable the results will be. <br>
              We continuously pre-minimize structures from the PDB using the commandline described below.
              If you specify a PDB ID that is contained in our database, the pre-minimized structure is used. <br><br>
              Otherwise we offer two modes of side-chain minimization, a short and a long one. The short one should take a few minutes, depending on the size of the protein. The long one may take some hours for large proteins.
              It is strongly recommended to use the long minimization, despite the significant waiting period. 
            </p>
            <b> AlphaFold and your own models</b>
            <p>These are not pre-minimized and you should follow the steps below. The AlphaFold models should be minimized, but the minimization has to be performed with the same energy functions than we use in the <span class="mut-ex">MutationExplorer</span>, namely Rosetta. </p>
            <strong> Do it yourself!</strong>
            <p> The minimizations we offer as 'long' and 'short' are both only side-chain optimizations.
              However, we recommend you to perform the following minimization. It is optimizing also the backbone in a limited way (due to '-relax:constrain_relax_to_start_coords'). A free backbone minimization might be leading to problems for e.g. membrane proteins. </p>
            <div class="codebox">
              <code>
                PATH_TO_ROSETTA/relax.static.linuxgccrelease   -relax:fast true -relax:cartesian true -score:weights ref2015_cart -use_input_sc -optimization::default_max_cycles 200 -linmem_ig 10 -relax:constrain_relax_to_start_coords -ex1 -ex2  -nstruct 20 -in:file:s  INPUT.pdb -out:pdb -out:prefix  OUTDIR/
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This commandline will create 20 models, from which you should select the one with the lowest energy. Each PDB contains a line starting with 'pose'. In this line you want the last value, which is the total energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Database of pre-minimized structures from the Protein Databank (PDB)</b><br><br>
              Since the minimization is essential for correctly highlighting the energetic impact of mutations, but  takes no small amount of time to perform, we calculated a database of pre-minimized structures from the PDB. Currently our database  contains 45,000 models. You will be notified if your PDB ID was found in our database or has to be calculated.<br>

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span> 
          <p>
            RaSP is a new deep-learning-based tool that rapidly
          estimates protein stability changes. RaSP predictions
          strongly correlate to scores from Rosetta calculations
            which demand longer compute times. <br><br>
            With RaSP, <span  style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> 
           presents the user with a quick initial
          estimation of a mutationâ€™s (de)stabilizing effect, without
            having to wait for the longer full minimization process.
            <br><br>
            RaSP will calculate all mutations for all amino acids in a chain within ~10 minutes. <br><br>
            If this option is selected, you can press the Ctrl key and left-click on the residue in the viewer.
            This will open a frame with 20 energy estimates.

            <b>6.2) Sequence Alignment</b><br><br>

            You can mutate the model that you uploaded in previous step using a sequence alignment in ClustalW format. One of the sequences in the alignment has to match <b>exactly one sequence</b> in the PDB that you uploaded in previous step. Since one alignment is associated with one chain, you can upload up to three alignments. If you need to mutate more than three chains, you can upload target sequences for the other chains or define mutations manually.<br><br>

            <b>6.3) Target Sequence</b><br><br>

            Provide the sequence for each chain of the uploaded PDB that it will be mutated to. The target chain sequences as a chain of one-letter sequences can be provided as FASTA files (top), pasted directly (center) or directly fetched from UniProtKB (bottom)

            What AlphaFold is not able to do is to model different states of a protein.
            This can be achieved using <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span>.
            For many classes and families of proteins, multiple states are available in the PDB.
            Different states can be modeled By selecting different PDBs as base structure and follow these steps:

          <ul class="true-list" id="input-list">
            <li> under &ldquo;upload structure and mutations&rdquo; enter the PDB ID of the base structure or upload a model from your machine </li>
            <li> ideally select the long minimization (for homology modeling the RaSP option can be disabled) and click the 'next' button </li>
            <li> for uploading the sequence to which you want to modify the base structure to there are multiple choices: </li>
            <ul  style="margin: 2em; margin-top: 0.5em">
              <li> paste or upload it under &ldquo;target sequence&rdquo; (when the target is rather similar to your base structure / template) </li>
              <li> if your target sequence has an Uniprot ID you can enter that </li>
              <li> you will have to indicate to which chain in the base structure the sequence shall be applied (available chains are listed) </li>
              <li> if it is a very remote relationship, follow the <a href="#alignme">AlignMe procedure</a></li>
              <li> for other cases either also use <a href="#alignme">AlignMe</a>, or upload an alignment from another source via &ldquo;sequence alignment&rdquo;</li>

            The part that cannot be done by <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> is the minimization of the model.
            The user can choose between different possibilities, e.g. using Rosetta as explained above, or by performing MD simulations and many others.
            Whatever approach the user choosed, it requires sufficient sampling and thus has to be done locally.

          <p>
            Structures deposited in the PDB are very often modified in order to solve them experimentally. 
            Using <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span>, it is a simple two-step process to mutate them back to their native sequence.
            Thus it is common step for simulating proteins to back-mutate PDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it should be noted that at its current state <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> is not able to complete the structure by modeling missing parts in the PDB.

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
          Molecular dynamics simulation can generate ensembles of functionally relevant states. <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> maps those ensembles to close or distant homologs. For close homologs, an alignment will be automatically generated internally. Alternatively, a pre-calculated sequence alignment can be provided. Where more refined alignments are required, the server accepts results forwarded from the AlignMe website (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac391">https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac391</a>). Such sequence alignments carry nuanced details and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> drills down to reveal them all.

        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
          When designing proteins, the effect of the variant is often only known after applying of an external software, via multiple design rounds. After each of those, the structures can be inspected. The power of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> lies in the possibility to do this directly in the viewer and select novels rounds of mutations immediatley and due to their influence on the structure.

          3D mapping of energies is not limited to monomers. Over single or multiple rounds of mutations, protein complexes or protein-protein interfaces can flexibly be designed to achieve (de)stabilization. The effect of each design choice can be explored visually.

<h5>General remarks:</h5>

<ul class="collapsible">
    <li>
        <div class="collapsible-header grey lighten-4">
          Limitations
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
          Currently, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> has no potentials targeted for membrane proteins available. Especially for residues facing the membrane, a special score-function and preparation is desired. Other residues, especially those outside of the membrane can be investigated with <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> without limitations.<br><br>
          Moreover, some mutations are generally challenging for Rosetta, foremost those from or to proline. Mutations from glycine may require conformational adaptation beyond the protocols used here, but proteins may be more flexible.<br><br>

          Ligands can only be handled as far as they are included in Rosettaâ€™s
          energy/scoring functions. <br><br>

          <span style="font-variant:small-caps">MutationExplorer</span> cannot
          handle very large structures, such as CryoEM structures
          available only in CIF format. Partial AlphaFold models
          for transcripts with more than 2,700 amino acids are not
          supported. We also caution that for large structures our default
          protocols for minimizations might be insufficient. Users
          should definitely minimize these on their local computer
          before upload. For this purpose, we recommend using the
          according <a href="#mini">command lines</a>. </p>
