<h4>RaSP model</h4>
<p>
    RaSP is a deep-learning-based tool that rapidly estimates
    protein stability changes. With RaSP, Mutation Explorer presents the user with a quick initial
    estimation of a mutation's (de)stabilizing effect, without their having to wait for the longer full
    minimization process. The RaSP tool consists of two linearly linked networks. A self-supervised 3D
    convolutional neural network that has learned representations of protein structures is followed by a
    fully connected neural network that maps these internal representations to Rosetta protein stability
    changes. RaSP is optimised for accuracy in the range [-1,7] kcal/mol.

<p>
    This command will create a RaSP model for each chain of the structure. This can take up to 10
    minutes per chain.</p>
<p>
    Once this option is selected, it will be applied in all subsequent steps accordingly.

    <b>Please note:</b> RaSP requires complete models containing side-chains.
