<h4>Mutate current model</h4>
<p>
    You can mutate the model that you uploaded in previous step using the syntax:<br> CHAIN
    ':'
    PDB-RESIDUE-ID AA-TYPE<br>Separate multiple mutations with commas.<br>Example:
    'A:12G,B:123A'<br>This
    would mutate residue with the PDB residue ID 12 in chain A to glycine and residue with
    the ID 123 in
    chain B to alanine.
