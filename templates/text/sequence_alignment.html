<h4>Define mutations by sequence alignment</h4>
<p>
    You can mutate the model that you uploaded in previous step using a sequence alignment in
    ClustalW
    format.<br>
    One of the sequences in the alignment has to match exactly one sequence in the PDB that
    you uploaded in
    previous step.<br>
    Since one alignment is associated with one chain, you can upload up to three
    alignments.<br>
    If you need to mutate more than three chains, you can upload target sequences for the
    other chains or
    define mutations manually.
