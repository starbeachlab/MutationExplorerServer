<h4> Interface Score Info Box </h4>

<h5> Binding score </h5>
InterfaceAnalyzer calculates the <b>binding energy</b> by scoring the input structure twice: first, as a
complex, and second, after moving the two sides of the interface away from each other, exposing the
interface. The idea is that energy score of the residues that are interacting with residues on the other
side of the interface is going to change after those residues are exposed.
The Rosetta energy scores of the unbound state are then subtracted from the scores of the bound one. Both
the bound (input structure provided by user) and unbound structures have their side chains optimized prior
to scoring. Since side chain optimization is stochastic, the mover is run 3 times, and the median score is
taken for every residue.

<h5> Interface selection </h5>
InterfaceAnalyzerMover which we use for the binding score calculation takes as an input a list of all chains
in the structure, with interface sides separated by <kdb>_</kdb>. For example, for the protein complex with
chains A, B, and C, you can select interfaces <kdb>A_BC</kdb>, <kdb>B_AC</kdb>, and <kdb>C_AB</kdb>. Which
side is which does not affect the score, so <kdb>A_BC</kdb> is the same as <kdb>BC_A</kdb>.
You can specify the interface yourself choosing which chains goes to which side, or you can choose an <b>All
    vs all</b> mode, which will result in great increase of the runtime. In this mode, the InrefaceAnalyzer
is run separately for every chain, consecutively specifying one of the chains as the left side of the
interface, with all other chains being assigned as the right side. Thus, the user can see binding dG values
for all of the interface residues for the entire structure.

<h5> Calculation time </h5>
1. If you provide the interface, <b>the addition to the overall running time</b> should be under 5 minutes,
depending on the number of chains and the size of the structure.
2. If you choose the all vs all option to see all possible interfaces in the structure, the running time
heavily depends on the number of chains, because IntefaceAnalyzer will run for every chain separately. Our
estimate runtime for a complex with averagely sized (~300 residue) chains is about N_chains * 5, <b>plus the
    overall running time</b>.
