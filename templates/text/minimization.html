<h4>Minimization</h4>
<p>
    The minimization is crucial if you want to analyze the energetic impact of mutations. The better the
    structure
    is energetically minimized, the more reliable the results will be. <br><br>
    If you select <b> none </b>, coloring the structures by energy or energy difference is possible but
    does not
    provide reliable information. <br><br>

    We continuously pre-minimize structures from the PDB using the commandline described below.
    If you specify a PDB ID that is contained in our database, the pre-minimized structure is used. <br>
    Otherwise we offer two modes of side-chain minimization, a short and a long one. The short one
    should take a
    few minutes, depending on the size of the protein. The long one may take some hours for large
    proteins.
</p>

<h4> AlphaFold and your own models</h4>
<p>These are not pre-minimized and you should follow the steps below. The AlphaFold models should be
    minimized,
    but the minimization has to be performed with the same energy functions than we use in the <span
        class="mut-ex">MutationExplorer</span>, namely Rosetta. </p>

<h4> Do it yourself!</h4>
<p> The minimizations we offer as 'long' and 'short' are both only side-chain optimizations.
    However, we recommend you to perform the following minimization. It is optimizing also the backbone
    in a
    limited way (due to '-relax:constrain_relax_to_start_coords'). A free backbone minimization might be
    leading
    to problems for e.g. membrane proteins. </p>

<p>
    This commandline will create 20 models, from which you should select the one with the lowest energy.
    Each PDB
    contains a line starting with 'pose'. In this line you want the last value, which is the total
    energy.
