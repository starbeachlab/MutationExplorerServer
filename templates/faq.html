    <div class="collapsible-header">
        How can I upload structures?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        There are three different ways of uploading: from the Protein Databank (PDB), from
	the AlphaFold website, from your local machine. All three possibilities are shown on the
	initial submit page. You have to provide the PDB ID, the AlphaFold ID, or select a file
	from your computer, accordingly.

    <div class="collapsible-header">
        How can I define mutations?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        Once you submitted the structure, a second page opens. On that page you are asked
	to define your mutations. There are four ways of defining your mutations:
	<ol>
	  <li> define any number of mutations manually using the graphical user interface.
See FAQ (link to next) for a detailed explanation of the syntax.</li>
	  <li> upload sequencing data (VCF format).</li>
	  <li> upload a sequence alignment (clustalW format) </li>
	  <li> provide a target sequence </li>
	  <ol>
	    <li> upload file (Fasta format) </li>
	    <li> Uniprot-ID </li>
	    <li> paste sequence </li>
	  </ol>
	</ol>
    </span></div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">
    What is the syntax for manually defining mutations?
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <span>
      For each mutation you have to provide in this order:
      <ol>
	<li> the chain as written in the PDB file </li>
	<li> the ’:’ separator </li>
	<li> the residue number </li>
	<li> the one letter code of the target amino acid </li>
      </ol>
      
      You can define any number of mutations, separated by commas.
      Example: ”A:12G,B:123W”: two mutations are defined, first, in chain A residue 12 is
      mutated into glycine, second, in chain B residue 123 is mutated into tryptophan.

  <div class="collapsible-header">
    How is the VCF sequencing format evaluated?
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <span>
      First, a suitable PDB is determined.
      Second, the mutations are applied.

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">
    What coloring schemes are available?
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
      You can color structures by energy, sequence conservation and properties such as hydropho-
bicities. For the energy coloring red means an increased energy due to the mutation(s),
blue an increased energy, and white no change. For sequence conservation blue means
conserved and red means not conserved. For hydrophobicity blue means hydrophilic and
red means hydrophobic.
  </span></div>

<li>
    <div class="collapsible-header">
        How to use an alignment to define mutations?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        There are two reasons for using alignments. First, an alignment is a way of defining
potentially many mutations. Second, by looking at differences in structure and energy can
provide deep insights into the alignment itself. Obviously, only aligned positions can be
used to define mutations. Gaps cannot be translated into mutations.

        Is it possible to mutate peptides?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        The smaller the peptide the more likely it is to be flexible. MutationExplorer has no restrictions concerning the size of the protein being uploaded. However, you should be aware that any conformation is just a snapshot and the smaller your peptide the more likely a given conformation may not represent the effect of a mutation on another conformation.

    <div class="collapsible-header">
        Is it possible to mutate transmembrane proteins?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
        In general yes. However, there is no energetic effect due to the lipid bilayer considered at this point.
